SECURITY

I'm no professional but I run with regularly wiped OS and an updated systems usually. The script should run fine with the latest macOS Big Sur, Excel,
and AppleScript. I make no warranties, however, and you should use your best judgement of how old the project is and whether you trust an open source solution to your needs.
