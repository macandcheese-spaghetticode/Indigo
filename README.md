An improved fetching script for a cryptocurrency website. Further work could be done on this code to fetch additional currencies. The script was saved as an application and initiates with a run/quit dialog box to start the program. It then operates an idle loop continuosly calling an HTTP transfer code. The code would need to be modified by the user to call the path and filename of an already saved Excel file with 3 sheets.

Also, the operation is still a bit clunky and may bother the user by continuously running an open excel file. Additional work is currently planned to learn how to build a light weight window plotting application that can display a live line graph that that adjusts the x and y axis accordinly. Sometimes my imagination is too great for my abilities, however, and it is unclear where this project may go. It is currently run by a sole contributor with limited funds to dedicate to the project. No outside funding is necessary but if commercial applications are implemented I wouldn't deny that I could use some funding to help with living expenses and student loans. Please feel free to utilize it for free if you are in the same boat.
